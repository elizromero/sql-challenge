# sql-challenge
This research project involves analyzing a dataset of employees who worked for a fictional company during the 1980s and 1990s. The only records that remain from that period are six CSV files. The project was divided into the following parts:

1. Data Modeling
Created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables using Quick Database Diagrams.

2. Data Engineering
Developed the database schema and created the tables using PostgreSQL. The CSV files were then imported into the corresponding tables.

3. Data Analysis
Constructed SQL queries to extract and analyze the required information from the dataset.
